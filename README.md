Community collaboration on proposals for USD

## New proposals
Fork this repo, create a directory for the proposal and its materials, then submit a PR.
The proposal will be landed, and iteration and collaboration will take the form of issues, and pull requests on the new materials.

By submitting a proposal, a contributor warrants that they have the rights to contribute the associated matter to the usd-wg/proposals project under the terms of CC0. Contributions outside of CC0 would require further discussion.

## License
The default license in this repo is CC0, but if a proposal is brought forward for integration into Pixar's Universal Scene Description, it is intended that the proposal and copyright will became subject to the terms that govern USD itself.

## Structure
Active proposals shall exist at the top level of the repo as siblings. At such time as a proposal's status changes, it may be moved into a folder named `inactive` or `accepted` as appropriate.

## Code of Conduct
Civility, inclusiveness, friendship, and constructive collaboration shall be the hallmarks of this forum.

Thank you for your participation!
